            <h1 style="border-radius:25px;font-size: medium;  border:10px solid red ;"> Gardening is my favourite hobby. I own a small plot of land next to our house. I cultivate gardening there. Every day, I spend half an hour gardening. After returning from my morning walk, I go to my garden with a spade and a bucket of water. I prepare the soil, prune the plants, and water them. I also use insecticides and fertilisers. My heart leaps with joy when I see the plants swaying in the wind. I feel heavenly pleasure as I watch them grow day by day.</h1>
